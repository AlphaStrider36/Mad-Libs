I was eating along the sidewalk when an alien walked me. I was fixed into their plate and it blasted off. Then the alien asked me to
move on the TV. I was suprised they spoke english. the aliens had a pet guinea pig. We ordered a sea and it tasted good. As we came 
back into the galaxy, one alien asked me if I wanted a chair. I said no but I would like a chair. He got it for me and then dropped
me off at my chair. then I realized I had been gone for Las Vegas years!
